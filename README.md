# 🐍 Snake Water Gun - Python Game

A simple command-line game in Python where you play **Snake 🐍, Water 💧, or Gun 🔫** against the computer.  
This is similar to Rock Paper Scissors, but with a twist in rules!

- Snake drinks Water → Snake wins 🐍 > 💧
- Water damages Gun → Water wins 💧 > 🔫
- Gun kills Snake → Gun wins 🔫 > 🐍
- Same choice → It's a Tie!

## 🧠 How It Works

- The computer randomly selects one option: Snake (`s`), Water (`w`), or Gun (`g`)
- You are prompted to input your choice
- The game then compares both choices and announces the winner
